# What is AORTA?

**AORTA**, or *An Open Revision Tool for Assessments*, is a free and open-source
web application which hosts medical learning objectives and multiple-choice
questions to test those learning objectives. 

# Why was AORTA developed?

Medical students commonly practise and test their knowledge by answering
questions about things they know. Many students find answering questions to be
helpful in revealing gaps in their knowledge because questions need to be
answered by actively recalling information.

However, it can be difficult to find questions which specifically target your
learning objectives and material. Questions from textbooks can sometimes be
outdated or irrelevant. Sourcing questions can become very costly. 

We developed AORTA to collect a repository of questions attached to
learning objectives to offer a free alternative to proprietary question banks.
Many medical students make their own targeted questions as part of their
revision, and we hope we can collect a communal sample of these questions to help
medical students revise in an effective and objective-focused manner. 

# Where is AORTA hosted?

AORTA is currently hosted at https://aorta.cigmah.org. Please note that this
application is still in an early development phase with limited content.

# How do I find out when AORTA will be ready?

Updates on the status of AORTA will periodically be posted to our AORTA Facebook
page at https://www.facebook.com/aorticroot/.
