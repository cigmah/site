> *Yingtong is currently a third-year medical student at Monash and the secretary of [MUMUS](https://mumus.org/committee/), Monash University&rsquo;s medical student society. Yingtong was the Puzzle Prize recipient for [Puzzle No. 7C, *Infectious Network*](https://cigmah.github.io/cgmnt/#/puzzles/7), and we were fortunate to have a chat with Yingtong about his programming experience and his views on how it interfaces with medicine.*



# How did you start to learn programming?

I think it&rsquo;s a little bit difficult for me to say. Both of my parents studied
software engineering when they were in university - even though only one of them
works in that field now, there were lots of books on that topic around the home
when I was young. So I guess in just a general sense, it was something that
seemed interesting and something I picked up - I did some reading about it, had
some practice and it&rsquo;s stuck with me since then. I started off with Java - that
was what the university courses and texts used to allow and were about. I used
it for quite some time, but in the past maybe four or five years I&rsquo;ve tended
to use Python more.



# Why did you start to learn programming?

I think when I was young, it was something novel, something interesting and
something to take up my time - and it&rsquo;s bit of a cycle that when you improve at
something, it&rsquo;s something you enjoy. But I suppose more of a reason why I do
it now is for practical reasons - having a grasp of technology helps you be
more productive with your work, helps you save time and to some extent enjoy
your work more.



# What do you use programming for currently?

Currently, there&rsquo;s two main areas where I use it. The first is directly involved
in my study and the second is more on the side. In terms of study, I&rsquo;ve recently
been poking around with SPSS and Jupyter and things like that, doing statistics
and plotting graphs - those sorts of analyses, when you get to grips with them,
become a lot easier and a lot more versatile when you have access to the full
suite of tools at the computer&rsquo;s disposal. I recently completed the [SPH Summer
Scholarship program](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/study/summer-vacation-program) and I did some work in statistics and data analysis there -
that&rsquo;s one of the areas where I got to practically apply programming. Even
things like making small scripts to help out with doing repetitive jobs are very
useful.

More generally - I&rsquo;ve been involved in MUMUS a couple of years, and over the
holidays we noticed we had had real problems keeping track of membership and
communicating with our members, so I built a little membership database and an
email bulletin system to replace our old one. Another example is, last year I
was on the committee for the residents&rsquo; ball and I heard the previous year the
committee had spent a couple of hours on table allocations trying to put
everyone together, so I threw together a quick script to pool the combinations
and that saved a lot of time as well. So I think it&rsquo;s just another tool to have
at your disposal.



# How do you think programming can be applied to medicine in the future?

I guess our world is becoming increasingly technologically focused - we&rsquo;ve gone
quite a way through that process already with things like many hospitals moving
towards electronic medical records. Technology&rsquo;s touched many areas of our lives
and I don&rsquo;t think medicine will be any different. For practitioners, there are
things like decision support tools, and for patients, for example, Monash
produced the creators of Eyenaemia, you hear a lot about that. Plenty of things
like automatic infusion pumps, medical engineering technology,
healthcare-related apps you put on your smartphone - the potential is absolutely
enormous.



# As a student studying medicine, where do you see programming in terms of your career?

I think computers are a tool - they&rsquo;re a tool you use like a pen and paper, like
a calculator. Tools are things you can use across all fields. No matter what
field you go into, you&rsquo;ll be able to use a pen and paper or a calculator, and
there will be a role for a computer. So I think just because medicine as a field
doesn&rsquo;t have these super-direct head-on interactions with programming, I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s necessarily a problem. So in terms of where I see this heading for
me, I think principally I expect it to continue heading in the same direction as
it has - if I see a problem in my job or somewhere else where programming could
help, I&rsquo;ll jump into that and see what can be improved. At the same time, there
are these intersectional areas - medical engineering, support systems etc. -
that I&rsquo;d be open to exploring as well.



# What are your thoughts on open source software?

I am absolutely a very big fan of free, open source software. For all of the
software I write that might be useful to someone else, I try very hard to put it
somewhere, whether it&rsquo;s on [my blog](https://yingtongli.me/blog/), a little snippet on [my GitHub](https://github.com/RunasSudo) or whether I
make a repo for it. I license all my code under [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License), and [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) for my
non-coding work. The tools are here to help us and if we&rsquo;re able to help other
people and help each other with that, that&rsquo;s only going to improve the outcomes we
see.



# For fun: what&rsquo;s your favourite programming language? IDE/Editor? OS?

I do like the versatility of Python and how quick it is to get things set up and
the syntactic sugar that&rsquo;s available. I think coming from Java going to Python,
it&rsquo;s great for getting things done. And there&rsquo;s great libraries for statistical
analysis, graphics, etc.

I run Linux as my daily driver - I use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/). I&rsquo;ve used Linux for a long time, so
that&rsquo;s essentially where my dev work is set up. Nowadays, I mostly just use
Emacs for simple text editing. My projects don&rsquo;t tend to be that big so I
haven&rsquo;t busted out a full-fledged IDE for quite some time.
