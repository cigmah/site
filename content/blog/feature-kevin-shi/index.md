> *Kevin is a medical student currently undertaking a BMedSc(Hons) at Monash, and the President of [MUMUS](https://mumus.org/committee/), Monash University&rsquo;s medical student society. Kevin was the Puzzle Prize recipient for [Puzzle No. 10C Bite Cell Scouting](https://cigmah.github.io/cgmnt/#/puzzles/10). We were fortunate to have the opportunity to ask Kevin some questions about his experience and views on how programming can relate to medicine.*

# How did you start to learn programming and why?

I was first introduced to programming / computer science in high school – we were
lucky enough to have a popular Programming Club that trained students for the
[Australian Informatics Olympiad](http://orac.amt.edu.au/) and other competitions.

I was short-listed for the Australian Informatics training programs in two
years, and attended a few related camps etc. in high school, and this gave me a
great opportunity to compete in competitions such as the French-Australian and
Asian Invitational Informatics Olympiads. I was also introduced to more
generalist programming competitions such as [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) which I still
participate in today when I find the time.


# What do you use programming for currently?

My most reliably updated project during my uni years has been my website –
originally used to hold lots of helpful resources, although these are slowly
being replaced by more human-friendly platforms like Google Drive. The most fun
project is the lecture bingo game that I wrote a shuffler for:

I also take turns maintaining some of the old MUMUS website tools and write
scripts to help process our membership data, although Yingtong has taken up
responsibility for lots of this in recent years.

Programming is a huge help in some very unlikely situations – for example,
preparing the Year 1 rep election ballots for counting was a huge process that I
automated in Python (otherwise distributing preferences between 16 candidates
would have been impossible) and I’m sure my day to day computer use would be
much more tedious without the occasional piece of code.


# How do you think programming can be applied to medicine?

In my opinion, the biggest issue facing our generation of doctors will be the
use of electronic medical records – software that will transform both clinical
practice and the retrospective research process. Having more doctors who are
familiar with the power of modern computing will accelerate findings from
clinical audits and registry projects, and we will soon be at the stage where
research questions can be tested against thousands of patients in minutes
through computer analysis of medical notes, investigations and drug charts.
Clinician-researchers will need to be well supported by staff with strong
computing skills to make the most of these opportunities and maximise patient
outcomes and safety.

However, many EMR systems are incredibly difficult to use, particularly for
older medical staff, and there is a risk that they could ‘dehuamanise’ medicine
through excessive clicking and form-filling instead of patient contact. It’s
also an emerging issue that they create huge medical records that nobody can
read in full and endanger patient safety through copy-pasting and overuse of
notice pop-ups (leading people to ignore important warnings). This has been the
focus of one of my favourite satire Twitter accounts:
<https://twitter.com/epicemrparody>. It’ll be up to doctors to understand the
possibilities of what computers and an EMR can do and contribute to the design
of a system that’s friendly for all clinical staff.

Of course, there are many exciting medical technology and diagnostic frontiers
in computer science but I haven’t been involved enough in these areas yet – but
it’s always exciting to see new advances in tech and how we’re solving problems
for patients and society!


# For fun: favourite programming language? IDE/Editor? OS?

My first language was C++ but I enjoy Python for its gentle learning curve and
accessibility: even if I haven’t written anything for a while it’s easy to pick
back up (and to search for any syntax you’ve forgotten, except I still make
plenty of mistakes using Python 2 statements in Python 3).

Editor – [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), although the online IDE’s like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) / [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) are becoming
very user friendly!

Up until very recently I did all my work using the default OSX command line –
I’ve recently switched to a PC and have installed the [Windows 10 / Ubuntu
environment](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows) which has been very pleasant to use.
