> *Prof Chris Bain is the inaugural Professor of Practice in Digital Health at Monash University&rsquo;s Faculty of Information Technology. Prof Bain has a diverse set of qualifications (including an MBBS, a Master of Information Technology, and a PhD in Information Systems) and has extensive experience in both clinical medicine and digital technology. He is also championing a fundraising campaign (the PWS 15for15 Challenge) for Prader Willi Syndrome, a genetic disorder with symptoms such as muscle weakness, insatiable appetite, and developmental delay.*



# What is *digital health*?

Defining *digital health* isn&rsquo;t as simple it seems. In brief, it means the use
of digital tools in healthcare and wellness. But I think there&rsquo;s an important
distinction between digital health and health IT. The hallmarks of digital
health are things like digital biomarkers, cloud technology, artificial
intelligence, remote care models, and patient engagement and empowerment. And
something to highlight here is that tools and interventions are not just aimed
at the people who provide care - they&rsquo;re aimed at everyone involved,
particularly patients. An example is [OpenNotes](https://www.opennotes.org/), a movement aiming to make
healthcare notes more transparent for patients.



# What are some other examples of digital health?

Here are some very *real* examples of what&rsquo;s happening right now outside
Australia. These are all examples of cutting-edge commercial technology that&rsquo;s
*out-there* and FDA-approved - it&rsquo;s not just research. And because they&rsquo;re FDA
approved, they all adhere to regulatory standards. It shows just how far we&rsquo;re
behind in Australia, but also where we&rsquo;re headed to. And as you look at these,
you&rsquo;ll start to think how different medical practice will look in the future.

# What are your thoughts on how medical care might change in the future?

Firstly, I think the answer to your question depends on where in the world you
are. For example, we&rsquo;re by some markers 10 years behind the US in terms of
digital health. The US has a different healthcare system to us, but we&rsquo;re plenty
happy to adopt surgical techniques and medicines from the US - and yet when it
comes to digital health, we get scared.

But I think if we do digital health right, we&rsquo;ll increasingly see evolution of
care more towards patients and communities and with less strain on health
professionals. Digital health means we can do this safely, so healthcare staff
can work on more challenging issues that computers can&rsquo;t help with and spend
more time with patients. That&rsquo;s how we *should* make it work, and I think the
new generations who grew up with technology will drive the change. I definitely
don&rsquo;t see robots taking over surgery any time soon, or AI absolutely replacing
all elements of clinical decision making - it&rsquo;s too complicated.



# What should medical students be learning about digital health?

Part of my job is to drive a digital health strategy at Monash. There&rsquo;s
definitely an increasing desire to know more - I show these products to people
and you can see their faces drop when they realise how they&rsquo;re preparing
students might have little resemblance with healthcare in the future.

We&rsquo;re still evolving what a digital health strategy for learning is and it looks
different to different professions, and at an undergraduate and postgraduate
level, and it looks different when you consider different development pathways
which might branch off into separate courses (e.g. &ldquo;X&rdquo;-informatics).

But that&rsquo;s different to making sure medical professions know what&rsquo;s coming. They
at least need a basic understanding of what digital health is, and what&rsquo;s good
and bad. They need to understand and think about how decision supports aids
might be used in their work, and maybe some basic knowledge on privacy and
security too.

But I also want to highlight - medical students have a say in this. You can talk
to your tutors and lecturers and can be the ones voicing any issues and
difficulties. You don&rsquo;t have a trivial part and can be the ones driving this forward.



# Tell us about the PWS 15for15 Challenge.

I&rsquo;ve had a number of experiences personally hearing about disability from
friends and family and it&rsquo;s something that needs to be put on the map. I only
first heard about fundraising efforts for Prader Willi Syndrome about 12 months
ago and was surprised that I hadn&rsquo;t heard about the campaign earlier. I also
found out that many others, including a major hospital, hadn&rsquo;t heard about it
either - a real problem as Prader Willi Syndrome is extremely underfunded.

So we&rsquo;re trying to put the campaign and cause on people&rsquo;s radar and I&rsquo;ve been
driving this with the [Prader Willi Syndrome Association of Victoria](https://www.pws.asn.au/). Prader
Willi Syndrome is much more common than people think with an incidence of
roughly 1/15,000 live births. It&rsquo;s more common than many other diseases people
know about and yet many people have never even heard of it. There&rsquo;s no cure and
people have it for life.

There&rsquo;s lots of opportunities to support the organisation and do research. The
[PWS 15for15 Challenge](https://15for15.raisely.com/) is a fundraising campaign for Prader Willi Syndrome. It&rsquo;s
about committing to a challenge for 15 days in a row during May, and importantly
it&rsquo;s about raising awareness. The challenge can be very simple, and we hope
people can tell others that they&rsquo;re doing it, and make sure Prader Willi
Syndrome becomes more known out there.
