# What is CIGMAH?

**CIGMAH**, or the *Coding Interest Group in Medicine and Healthcare*, is a group of medical students interested in learning to code. We mostly learn to code for fun, but people find avenues to code in real life as well. 

# Why CIGMAH? 

Many medical students with an interest in technology will be able to sustain
their interest by approaching technical challenges from the medical side.
Clinical experience is often invaluable to engineering teams and provides
important insight into the healthcare landscape.

However, we do believe there is still a place for medical students who want to learn how
to program themselves. Programming can be used in a wide variety of
situations including research, automation, teaching, game-making and app
development. Many students also find programming a fun and creative hobby that complements
their medical skills well.

We therefore wish to **support medical students who want to learn how to code** and to
**provide resources for programmers coming from a medical background**.

# What does CIGMAH do?

We:

1. Run tutorial nights and other events for students interested in learning to code (see [Events]({{<ref events>}})).
2. Develop open-source learning tools for medical students (see [Tools]({{<ref tools>}})).
3. Collect and create resources for learning how to code (see [Resources]({{<ref resources>}})).
4. Write articles relating to coding and medicine (see [Blog]({{<ref blog>}})).

# Who runs CIGMAH?

CIGMAH is run by students at Monash University. Our contributors are listed on [our Contributors page]({{< relref contributors >}}).

# What type of organisation is CIGMAH?

Officially, we are an [unincorporated entity](https://abr.business.gov.au/Help/EntityTypeDescription?Id=00031). The internal team is composed of
volunteers with a common interest, rather than as members of a business or
company. We freely release our content and do not collect profits on any tooling
or software we provide.
