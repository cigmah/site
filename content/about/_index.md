# What is CIGMAH?

**CIGMAH**, or the *Coding Interest Group in Medicine and Healthcare*, is a group of medical students interested in learning to code. We mostly learn to code for fun, but people find avenues to code in real life as well. 

# What does CIGMAH do?

We:

1. Run tutorial nights and other events for students interested in learning to code (see [Events]({{<ref events>}})).
2. Develop open-source learning tools for medical students (see [Tools]({{<ref tools>}})).
3. Collect and create resources for learning how to code (see [Resources]({{<ref resources>}})).
4. Write articles relating to coding and medicine (see [Blog]({{<ref blog>}})).

# Who runs CIGMAH?

CIGMAH is run by students at Monash University. Our contributors are listed on [our Contributors page]({{< relref contributors >}}).
