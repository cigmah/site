# How do I contribute to CIGMAH?

CIGMAH is run by volunteers and we always greatly appreciate more help. You
don't need coding experience to help out - we often need help to maintain the
website, curate resources, or manage social media. 

If you're already familiar with programming and contributing to open-source
projects, we also have a number of open-source projects on our [GitHub
organisation](https://github.com/cigmah/) where we welcome forks and pull
requests.

If you're keen to help, let us know - our contact details are on the [Contact]({{< ref
"/contact">}}) tab.
