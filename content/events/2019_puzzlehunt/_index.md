# What was the 2019 Puzzle Hunt?

The 2019 Puzzle Hunt was a year-long online set of puzzles released at a rate of
3 puzzles per month for a total of 24 puzzles. These puzzles ranged from puzzles
requiring no coding at all, to puzzles require significant programming skills.

We built a dedicated site to host the puzzles and the submissions system; the
site has now been deprecated and we have archived all material and source code.

A full write-up of the 2019 Puzzle Hunt is available at
https://cigmah.org/cgmnt/ and in [in PDF form
here](./2019_puzzlehunt_writeup.pdf).

The puzzle hunt puzzles have also been archived and are available from the
sidebar on the left. Some links may be broken, or formatting may have changed
when we migrated the puzzles to this site: if you notice any broken links or
improper formatting, please let us know.
