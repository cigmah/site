# What events does CIGMAH run?

We try to run tutorial nights throughout the year on a range of topics which relate
to coding and medicine. These tutorial nights are usually aimed at beginners, so
no prior coding experience is necessary. 

We also try to run a Puzzle Hunt sometime during the year, but this depends on
our available resources.

This section will be updated throughout the year.
