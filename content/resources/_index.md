# I want to learn programming. How should I start?

The best way to start to learn programming varies from person to person. Some
people prefer to learn from the ground-up through reading introductory and
foundation material, while others might benefit more from a direct hands-on
approach by starting a coding project. Gradually, you'll find what works for you.

The most important aspect of learning programming is **time**. Many concepts
will be unfamiliar, which makes them hard to understand. A common experience for
beginners is to explore a tutorial, only to find they encounter frustrating
errors and impenetrable teaching material. This can be particularly discouraging
when you have no one to ask to explain things.

We advise that you:

1. **Start with a goal in mind.** Do you want to learn how to automate some
   menial tasks? Or to make a game or an app? Or to do some statistics for a
   research project? These often involve different skills, and it may be easier
   to focus your time on one aspect first. 
2. **Ask for help often, from someone in real-life if you can.** It is often
   very helpful to have someone to guide you at the start. We run
   tutorial nights to help provide some in-person guidance on assorted topics.
3. **Stick with it.** Programming can be frustrating at times, and if you are
   new, you will probably feel overwhelmed at first. Over time, these feelings
   tend to subside and you'll feel more confident confronting unfamiliar territory.

There are many **resources** to help you learn programming. Below, we've
outlined some approaches that might help you get started, depending on your
goals. 

## I don't know why I want to learn programming, but I'd just like to learn it. 

This is common. We'd advise getting started with something visual that "gets
something on the screen fast", and you'll learn basic concepts on the way. If
nothing else, you get to make cool art.

- [Code! Programming with
  p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)
  is a YouTube playlist which walks through programming using **JavaScript** and
  a library (p5.js) to make interactive visualisations. The channel, [The
  Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) is
  also a great source of coding material in general. (Thanks to [Prof
  Wright]({{< relref "/blog/feature-chris-wright">}}) for
  suggesting this!)

It may seem useless to learn programming to make art, but it'll get you started
on important core concepts that'll help *a lot* when you branch into other areas
such as statistics, game development, or automation. You'll get immediate
feedback when you make art - a luxury that is unfortunately not true of every
type of programming. 

## I want to learn programming from the fundamentals.

There are a number of great resources online for learning programming as a
beginner from the very basics. Here's a few:

- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) - a
  comprehensive collection of resources, more geared towards those pursuing
  software engineering as a proper career than as a hobby, but very helpful as a
  resource guide.
- [MIT OpenCourseWare: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in
  Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
- [Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer
  Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
  
## I want to automate boring tasks.

You'll likely benefit from learning **Python**, a programming language which is
very easy to start scripting your computer's behaviour - such as renaming a lot
of files at once, or extracting text out of webpages.

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) -
  a popular book geared at using the Python programming language for pragmatic
  tasks in a hands-on approach.


## I want to practise problem solving.

Programming is often a useful tool for problem-solving. Here are some resources
which compile programming problems for you to practise with:

- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) - a huge collection of
  bioinformatics problems (ranging from very easy to very hard), helpful to
  practise coding skills.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - a collection of maths problems
  with computational solutions.
